  **Resubmission**
  
  1. Changed license to MIT to mirror change to MIT by Facebook/React
  2. "React" should now be all uppercase
  3. Do not want to add executable `babel_transform` example since many users do not use and do not want to have to install `V8`.  Use of `V8` also makes testing difficult.  However, it can be a very powerful tool when using with React, so I most definitely want to keep `babel_transform`.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 3.4.0
* rhub check_for_cran
* travis-ci
